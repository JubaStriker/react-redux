# 3️⃣ Respond to a webhook request

This section describes how your system should respond to an incoming webhook
request.

If you respond with a `2xx` code, our system will consider the webhook as
successfully sent and received.

If you respond with another status code than `2xx`, our system will consider the
webhook request as a `failure`.
